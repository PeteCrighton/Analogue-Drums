# Analogue Drums

This is a collection of SFZ files for some of the sampled drumkits provided by [Analogue Drums](http://analoguedrums.com/). No player-specific opcodes were used, so every SFZ player that supports SFZ 1.0 should be able to play these files, although they were only tested using [LinuxSampler](https://www.linuxsampler.org/).

Also included are MIDNAM files for every drumkit, which enable your DAWâ€™s MIDI editor to show the respective mapping. For [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) on Linux put these files in `~/.config/ardour4/patchfiles/` _(may need to be created)_. See this [Libre Music Production article](http://libremusicproduction.com/news/20151229-avl-drumkits-updated-version-10) for how to apply them to your MIDI tracks.
